# Lanboost's Pathfinding

A "simple" pathfinding library I created one weekend for a project I was doing.
The library includes A-star (A*) and SubGoal Optimized path finding.

## Algorithms
- Generic A-star
- 2D based SubGoal graph optimal pathfinder [[1]](#1)
 
## Example

https://lanboost.github.io/LanboostPathfindingSharp/

## Dependencies
- OptimizedPriorityQueue
- Moq [Test]
